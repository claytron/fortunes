The reason that no computer program can ever be a mind is simply that a
computer program is only syntactical, and minds are more than
syntactical. Minds are semantical, in the sense that they have more than
a formal structure, they have a content.

If it's there and you can see it - it's real.

I have a spelling checker,

Its letter perfect in it's weigh,
My checker tolled me sew.

Bright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing
eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and
waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike, at the buttons
and keys on which their attention seems to be riveted as a gambler's on
the rolling dice. When not so transfixed they often sit at tables strewn
with computer printouts over which they pore like possessed students of
a cabalistic text. They work until they nearly drop, twenty, thirty
hours at a time. Their food, if they arrange it, is brought to them:
coffee, Cokes, sandwiches.  If possible they sleep on cots near the
printouts. Their rumpled clothes, their unwashed and unshaven faces, and
their uncombed hair all testify that they are oblivious to their bodies
and to the world in which they move. These are computer bums, compulsive
programmers...

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it
wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to
be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a
large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding
mistakes in my own programs.
